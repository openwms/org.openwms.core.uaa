== Introduction and Goals
The OpenWMS.org UAA (User Authentication & Administration) Service is built to fulfill two different requirements regarding the handling of
`Users` of the system.

First the service is capable to act as [OpenID Connect](http://openid.net/connect) authentication endpoint and can authenticate users
against a persistent database.

The second part deals with administration of `Users` like creating new `Users`, updating properties of existing ones or deleting them. Most
application permissions were not directly assigned to `Users` explicitly, but to `Roles` instead. `Users` are assigned to `Roles` and
application permissions were granted to particular `Roles`. Administration of `Roles` and permissions is especially required for a UI
application.
