# Purpose
The OpenWMS.org UAA (User Account & Administration) Service deals with the administration of `Users` like creating new `Users`, updating
properties of existing ones or deleting them. Application permissions are not directly granted to `Users` explicitly, but to `Roles`
instead. `Users` are assigned to `Roles` and application permissions were granted to particular `Roles`. An administration API for `Roles`
and permissions is especially required for a UI application.

![classes][1]

An `User` has embedded `UserDetails`, and `Emails` assigned. However, the password history of the `User` is managed and compared against new
passwords. An `User` can be assigned to multiple `Roles`. A `Role` is a `SecurityObject` in general and has multiple `Grants` assigned. A
`Grant` is a permission that can be used in a client application.

# Deployment
The UAA is an essential component for all kind of applications and requires a high degree of availability. However, it is deployed in a
redundant setup in different locations, on different cloud platforms with different ISP.

# Build
Build a runnable fat jar with execution of all unit and in-memory database integrations:

```
$ mvnw package
```

Run the Sonar analysis:

```
$ mvnw package -Psonar
```

## Run
After the binary has been built it can be started from command line. No other infrastructure services are required to run this service.

```
$ java -jar target/openwms-core-uaa-exec.jar
```

In a distributed Cloud environment the service can itself register on a central discovery service - currently Eureka is supported only. This
behavior can be enabled by activating the Spring Profile `DISTRIBUTED`.

```
$ java -jar target/openwms-core-uaa-exec.jar --spring.profiles.active=DISTRIBUTED
```

Now the UAA service is registered at the discovery service at startup and can be looked up by other services by its name `uaa-service`.

## Release
```
$ mvn deploy -Prelease,gpg
```

### Release Documentation
```
$ mvn package -DsurefireArgs=-Dspring.profiles.active=ASYNCHRONOUS,TEST -Psonar
$ mvn site scm-publish:publish-scm
```
