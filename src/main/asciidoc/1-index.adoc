== Index

The initial HTTP request to retrieve information about all available resources looks like the following. The Index page is a public
available resource and does not need any authentication.

include::{generated}/get-index/http-request.adoc[]

The `Index` resource is returned in the response body with the response status of 200-OK. This main `Index` lists all primary resource
entities to follow next.

A client application only needs to know about the agreed link names and follow the corresponding `href` link to navigate to further
resources.
