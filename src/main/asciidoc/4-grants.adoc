== Grant
A `Grant` represents a permission to perform an action. A `Grant` can be assigned to a `Role` and is always tied to some kind of action that
can be taken. It has a unique business key, that is used in API or UI to protect against unauthorized access.

=== Grant Index
An overview of all possible operations on `Grants` can be found on the `Grant` index page that is retrieved with a `GET` request:

include::{generated}/grants-index/http-request.adoc[]

And the server responds with a `HAL+JSON` representation to further operations:

include::{generated}/grants-index/http-response.adoc[]

=== Find all Grants
To retrieve all existing `Grants` from the server, a client simply needs to do a `GET` request to the `Grants` resource.

include::{generated}/grants-findall/http-request.adoc[]

The server responds with a list representation of all `Grants` or an empty list:

include::{generated}/grants-findall/http-response.adoc[]
