= Representation Formats
Basically JSON is used as representation format by default if not otherwise requested or mentioned below. XML format is supported for the
index pages as well, but must be requested explicitly. Furthermore a vendor specific JSON format is used to represent resource
representations. Therefore it's absolutely required the `Accept` header denotes the demanded type. Find the type in the examples below.

== Dates in JSON
Date or datetime fields are not treated specially in JSON. Within the scope of this API a date or datetime field is always expected and
rendered as JSON String in ISO8601 format with timezone information and milliseconds: `yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSZ`.

== Embedded Entities
For the sake of convenience some response entities may included embedded entities or even parts of it. A reference to the actual entity is
provided as HAL link as well.

== Error Responses
Beside the actual representation of resources, the server may result an error response in JSON format that contains basic information about
the error occurred. This information is additional to the standard HTTP status code and may help clients to identify the error cause in
order to re-phrase and send the request again.

Currently there are two types of errors with their own response formats.

=== Server Declined Errors
This kind of errors are sent by the server runtime environment even before the request had a chance to be processed.

An example response looks like this:

```
{
    "timestamp": 1512400854941,
    "status": 500,
    "error": "Internal Server Error",
    "exception": "org.ameba.oauth2.InvalidTokenException",
    "message": "JWT expired at 2017-12-04T15:04:43Z. Current time: 2017-12-04T15:20:54Z, ...",
    "path": "/v1/transport-units?bk=00000000000000004711"
}
```

The JSON structure contains the following fields.

|===
| Property Name | Description

| timestamp     | When the error occurred on server side
| status        | The http status of the error
| error         | A short error text
| exception     | Internal class name of the Java exception type
| message       | A more descriptive error text describing the error in detail
| path          | The part of the URI for the REST resource that was queried
|===

=== API Declined Errors
Those errors are thrown within the REST API validation and processing logic. For example, if a client request does not match the expected
format or has produced an error on server side, the API will decline the request and return a response with status client-side error (4xx).

The structure of the response is aligned to the RFC7808. An example response looks like this:

```
{
    "message": "LocationGroup with name [NOT_EXISTS] not found",
    "messageKey": "COMMON.LOCATION_GROUP_NOT_FOUND",
    "obj" : [ "NOT_EXISTS" ],
    "httpStatus" : "404",
    "class" : "String"
}
```

The JSON structure contains the following fields.

|===
| Property Name | Description

| message       | A short error text
| messageKey    | An unique identifier across the API that can be used to identify and translate the error message on the client side
| obj           | An array of possible passed arguments to the message
| httpStatus    | The http status of the error
| class         | The arguments type
|===

Following message keys are currently used:

|===
| Message Key | Description | Action

| not.found   | The requested resource has not been found | The resource does not exist anymore or has never existed. The resource identifier must be verified
|===
