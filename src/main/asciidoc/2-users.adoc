==== User
A `User` represents a human user of the system, usually in front of an UI who interacts with the system. `User` representations can be
created, modified and retrieved. An `User` is also allowed to authenticate against an UAA endpoint.

=== Create am User
To create a new `User` instance a `POST` request must be send to the server with the mandatory fields of the `User` in the request body

If the `User` has been created successfully, the server returns the URI to the created resource:
